Title:
ESP32 NRF24L01 Anti-Jamming Detection & Analytics System

Description:
This project demonstrates a full-stack, professional-grade wireless anti-jamming system using ESP32 and NRF24L01. It captures, monitors, and analyzes RF packets in real-time, detects interference patterns, logs events, and provides a visualization dashboard.

Features:

Real-time wireless channel monitoring

RSSI / Packet loss detection

Jamming detection & mitigation (frequency hopping)

Alerts via LED, Buzzer, and Python dashboard

Detailed logging (CSV, JSON)

Python dashboard for graphs & reports

Usage:

Connect hardware (ESP32 + NRF24L01)

Flash main.ino via Arduino IDE / PlatformIO

Open serial monitor for logs

Run Python dashboard for live visualization

Professional Notes:

Designed for lab testing with controlled devices

Fully modular code, suitable for extension
